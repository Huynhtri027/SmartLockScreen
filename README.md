#SmartLockScreen

An android app, for balancing security and convinience, with **Environment sensitive passwords, Notifications in lockscreen, and Restricted User profiles**

##Features
- Define environments - Each environment can be a combination of any of Bluetooth devices, Wi-Fi network and Location.
- Set passphrase for each environment. The app detects environment changes and changes the passphrase automatically in the background.
How is this useful? Consider this: Say you define environment home, which says Home is when the phone is connected to Home Wi-Fi (you can use location also, or both together). For environment home, set password as none. And for unknown environment, you can set, say, a pattern lock. So whenever you are at home, you can unlock the phone easily, but when outside, it'll set a lock and prevent unauthorized usage by others.
Another scenario is adding an environment which checks for your bluetooth headset. Phone is automatically secured when you move away, and unlocks automatically when you come back to it.
These are just indicative. Possibilities are endless!
- Notifications in lock screen - Lollipop style! It's not totally there yet, it's an ongoing work. Swipe up/down to unlock, left for camera, right for dialer.
- Restricted profiles - Set up restricted profiles for your friends/family and limit access to apps. You can assign a different password to each restricted profile (password, pin, pattern or none).
- Intelligent environment overlap resolution. But you always have the option to override it manually.
- Material Design, and smooth animations.
- More features are coming soon!
